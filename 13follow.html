<h1>Follow the raven</h1>

<p>Your gut tells you you’ll regret not listening to the raven, so you walk towards it, waiting for it to respond. As you guessed, the raven flew a short distance away towards another tree and looked back at you, signaling for you to follow it with a loud caw. You follow behind the raven in a jog, hoping the bird won’t lead you astray. It comforted you that the raven stopped to look back at you every once in a while, making sure you were able to keep up and were still following.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour later, you found yourself out of the forest and spotted a gas station. Feeling relief wash over you, you trudged over with whatever strength you had left. You requested to use the store’s phone and were able to return home within a few hours.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You made it out alive :)</p>
