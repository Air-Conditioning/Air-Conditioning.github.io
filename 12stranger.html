<h1>Stranger danger</h1>

<p>Getting a bad feeling from the old woman before you, your adrenaline kicks in and you swing around to make a bolt for it.</p>

<p>“NO!” The deceivingly kind woman immediately dropped her facade and screeched while reaching out for the collar of your shirt.</p>

<p>Her nails barely miss your neck, shredding the fabric her nails came into contact with. You sprint without looking back, scared for your life—the forest blurs by as you run for what feels like hours. Finally, you see light in the distance. Despite the exhaustion pulling at your muscles, you push on like your life depends on it.</p>

<p>You finally reach past the trees, and you’re greeted with sunlight and a partly cloudy sky. You never believed you could’ve missed seeing the sky this much. Looking around, you find a road with a few cars driving by. You flag one down for the nearest hospital and reach it in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You made it out alive :)</p>
