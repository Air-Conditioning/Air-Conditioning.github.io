<h1>Drink from the river</h1>

<p>You inch your way closer to the raging river. You tell yourself that it may seem stupid now, but if you were able to pull it off, you could continue without being thirsty. Moving your foot down, you tentatively placed it on the wet stones that the river lapped at. It was when you tried shifting your other foot that caused you to slip, sending you tumbling into the ice-cold waters.</p>

<p>In a panic, you launched your head up for a breath of air, but the surging currents crashed against the back of your head, sending you back under. You flailed your limbs, trying to pull yourself in any direction but forward down the river. You battled against the waters for what felt like hours until you gave in to the exhaustion.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, you ended up getting what you wished for, but none of that mattered anymore as your vision faded to black, and the muffled sound of water grew distant in your mind.</p>

<p>You drowned :(</p>
