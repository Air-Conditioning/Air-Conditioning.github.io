<h1>Minecraft Art Page</h1>

<p>
    For this class assignment, we were instructed to make a sculpture in Minecraft of something that was culturally significant. I chose to build the character from the game Among Us. 
    Among Us is culturally significant to the internet because of how undeniably popular it became, gaining virility through memes. 
    I think part of why it grew so popular is because of how the game's simplicity (in relation to other games) is what made it accessible to audiences of all ages, especially younger audiences. 
    That combined with its cute and simple design is probably what allowed it to spread through the internet like wildfire. 
    Regardless of how we feel now that the trend has been exhausted, Among Us has left its mark on online culture.
