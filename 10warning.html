<h1>The raven's warnings</h1>

<p><img src="ravencall.png" alt="ravencall"></p>

<p>Turning around, your eyes scan the shadowy trees before landing on a raven that is frantically cawing at you. Its feathers are puffed up and it doesn’t seem to want you getting any closer to the river. You consider listening to the bird, but part of you is practically begging to dive into the water.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p><a href="13follow.html">—> Heed the raven’s call and follow it.</a></p>

<p><a href="11drink.html">—> It’s probably just a coincidence. Ignore it and reach down towards the river.</a></p>
