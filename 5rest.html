<h1>Resting to recover energy</h1>

<p>You walk to the nearest rock that has a flat enough surface to sit comfortably on. You lean back into a position you decide is the most comfortable and wait…</p>

<p>Sitting on this rock, you feel a bit calmer and level-headed. You continue to wait and rest…</p>

<p>And wait…</p>

<p>And wait…</p>

<p>And wait…</p>

<p>An unknown amount of time passes before you sigh to yourself. At least you do feel a bit more rested.</p>

<p>The caw of a raven startles you to your feet.</p>

<p><a href="8raven.html">—> What was that?</a></p>
