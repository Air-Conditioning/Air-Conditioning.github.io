<h1>The noisy raven</h1>

<p><img src="ravencall.png" alt="ravencall"></p>

<p>Looking up at the branches of a tree behind you, a raven peers at you with its intelligent eyes. It’s almost as if it's staring through you like it wants something from you.</p>

<p>It caws at you one, two, three times before flap-jumping to another branch. It caws once more. It seems like it wants you to follow.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p><a href="13follow.html">—> You decide to follow the raven.</a></p>

<p><a href="6cabin.html">—> Your parents told you not to trust strangers. That doesn’t exclude birds. Ignore the raven and check out the cabin instead.</a></p>
