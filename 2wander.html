<h1>Wander around aimlessly</h1>

<p>You figure there’s no point in waiting around so you start walking in a random direction, hoping to come across anything you might recognize. In the distance, you can make out the faint silhouette of a cabin. At the same time, you faintly hear the sound of running water.</p>

<p>What do you do next?</p>

<p><a href="6cabin.html">—> I’ll have better luck getting food, water, and information from the cabin.</a></p>

<p><a href="7water.html">—> That cabin looks sketchy… I’m going to check out the water source.</a></p>
