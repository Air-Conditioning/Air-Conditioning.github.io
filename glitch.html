<h1>Glitch Art Page</h1>

<p>
    This is my glitch art series. I chose to glitch mountains because I find them to be majestic landforms.
    I also find it almost poetic how mountains and other landforms are created and built upon through chance, similarly to glitches, but with a reason behind the creation.
